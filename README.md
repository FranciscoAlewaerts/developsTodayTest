# Country Info App - Full-Stack JS

This is a full-stack project that provides information about countries, including border countries, population over time, and the URL for the country's flag. The backend is built with Node.js (Express or Nest), and the frontend is built with React.js (Next.js preferred).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (version 6 or higher)
- **Git** (optional)

## Project Structure

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

   The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Both Servers

To run both the frontend and backend simultaneously, follow these steps:

1. Open two terminal windows or tabs.
2. In one terminal, start the backend server by following the instructions above.
3. In the other terminal, start the frontend server by following the instructions above.

Now, the frontend will be able to make requests to the backend without any issues.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to start both the backend and frontend of the application. If you encounter any issues, check the dependencies or the configuration settings.

Happy coding!
